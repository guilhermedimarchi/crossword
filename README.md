### How to run
You can run a command like `python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt`, specifying a structure file and a words file. If an assignment is possible, you should see the resulting assignment printed. You may also add an additional command-line argument for an image file, as by running `python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png`, to generate an image representation of the resulting crossword puzzle as well.
